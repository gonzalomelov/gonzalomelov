### Hi there 👋

🌎 I'm a software engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay.


👨‍💻 I have been building software and developing products for over 12 years.


👨‍🎓 I hold a BSc in Computer Science and a Diploma of Specialist in Technology Management from [FING-UDELAR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/).


⛓️ Although my journey with blockchain dates back to 2017, when we proposed a Hyperledger solution for the Uruguayan government in a [hackathon](https://hackathon.bps.gub.uy/propuestas), I have been professionally involved in the Web3 space since 2022. That year, I joined [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) to help scale the [NFT marketplace](https://www.sandbox.game/en/shop/) to a broader audience. Currently, I am delving deeper into NFT Marketplaces at [Web3Pro](https://www.web3pro.com/).


🚀 Previously, I contributed to the growth and successful exit of [KONA](https://ibsintelligence.com/ibsi-news/technisys-acquires-conversational-ai-innovator-kona-to-elevate-digital-banking-experience/), an AI startup focused on conversational agents for the banking industry.
